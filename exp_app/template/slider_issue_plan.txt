Here is the comprehensive plan to address the issue with the slider:

### Plan:

1. **Check for JavaScript Errors**:
   - Open the browser console to look for any JavaScript errors that may be preventing the Swiper slider from functioning correctly.

2. **Inspect CSS Styles**:
   - Review the CSS files (`style.css` and `bootstrap.css`) to ensure there are no conflicting styles that might affect the slider's layout or visibility.

3. **Verify HTML Structure**:
   - Ensure that the HTML structure for the slider in both `base.html` and `index.html` is correct, with all required classes and elements present.

4. **Test Slider Functionality**:
   - After making any necessary adjustments, test the slider functionality in the browser to confirm that it is working as expected.

5. **Document Findings**:
   - Document any changes made and the results of the tests to ensure clarity for future reference.

### Follow-up Steps:
- If the slider is still not functioning after these checks, further investigation may be needed, including reviewing the Swiper documentation for any additional configuration options.
